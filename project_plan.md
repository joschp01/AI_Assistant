# Project Plan: ROS-Specific Voice Assistant


## Phase I: Requirements Analysis

**Core Features**

1. Wake word detection (e.g., "Hey Jarvis").
1. Natural language understanding for ROS-related queries.
1. Text-to-speech (TTS) for responses.
1. ROS-specific knowledge base integration.
1. Local execution (privacy-focused).

**Optional Features**

1. Contextual conversation.
1. Extendability for adding custom ROS functionalities (e.g., running ROS nodes).

## Phase II: Technology and Tools Selection

1. Wake Word Detection
    - Local Option: Porcupine by Pico voice (https://picovoice.ai/products/porcupine/) (easy to implement, efficient).
    - Customizable Option: Fine-tune models like Snowboy (for better understanding of your wake word).
2. Speech-to-Text (STT)
    - Local Option: Coqui STT (https://coqui.ai/) (open-source and customizable).
    - Fine-Tuning: Train Coqui models with your voice data for better accuracy.
    - Learning-Oriented Option: Use Mozilla DeepSpeech. (https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech)
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    - Beginner-Friendly Option: Use Hugging Face Transformers (e.g., fine-tune GPT models for ROS knowledge).
    - Advanced Learning: Fine-tune a smaller NLP model like DistilBERT on ROS documentation.
4. Text-to-Speech (TTS)
    - Local Option with Most Natural Output: VITS (https://github.com/jaywalnut310/vits) : A state-of-the-art, open-source TTS model for generating natural and expressive speech.

        *Note: Why **VITS**? It combines speech synthesis and vocoder tasks, producing realistic speech in real time. Fine-tuning is possible for creating a personalized voice assistant.*

    - Alternative Option: FastSpeech 2 (https://github.com/ming024/FastSpeech2) : Another powerful model with fast inference speed and near-human quality output.

    - Learning-Focused Option: Experiment with simpler TTS models like Tacotron 2 or WaveNet to understand the basics of speech synthesis.

5. ROS Knowledge Base
     - Static Option: Create a database from ROS documentation using a JSON or SQLite format.
     -  Dynamic Option: Use embeddings via OpenAIâ€™s Embedding API or local libraries like SentenceTransformers to dynamically retrieve answers.
     - Hardware Recommendations
        1. Raspberry Pi 4 (local prototype).
        2. Laptop or desktop with a GPU for fine-tuning and initial development.

## Phase III: Development

### Step 1: Wake Word Detection
 * Install and configure Porcupine or Snowboy.
 * Train or customize a wake word model.
### Step 2: Speech-to-Text (STT)
 * Integrate Coqui STT for real-time voice-to-text conversion.
 * Fine-tune Coqui with your dataset of common ROS-related queries.
### Step 3: NLP Integration
 * Fine-tune a Hugging Face model on ROS tutorials, FAQs, or your source material.
 * Use pre-trained embeddings for semantic search within ROS documentation.
### Step 4: Text-to-Speech (TTS)
 * Implement VITS or FastSpeech 2 for generating natural, expressive speech.
 * Fine-tune the chosen TTS model to create a specific tone or personality for the assistant.
### Step 5: ROS Knowledge Base
 * Parse ROS documentation into a structured knowledge base (e.g., SQLite database with topics and answers).
 * Implement a retrieval system using embeddings or simple keyword search.
### Step 6: System Integration
 * Integrate STT, NLP, and TTS modules into a pipeline.
 * Implement an event loop that listens for the wake word and processes user queries.

## Phase IV: Testing and Fine-Tuning

 **Unit Testing**

 * Test individual modules (wake word, STT, NLP, TTS).
 
 **Integration Testing**

 * Ensure seamless flow between modules (voice to response).
 
 **User Testing**

 * Gather feedback on accuracy and usability.
 
 **Fine-Tuning**

 * Refine NLP models based on user interactions and specific ROS terms.
 * Optimize STT and TTS models for your hardware.

## Phase V: Deployment and Learning
### Local Deployment
  1. Deploy on a Raspberry Pi or a local machine.
  1. Optimize resource usage for real-time performance.
  1. Future Enhancements
     * Add features like running ROS nodes directly or controlling robots via voice commands.
     * Implement multi-turn conversations for more interactive queries.
