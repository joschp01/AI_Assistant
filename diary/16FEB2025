Since the ovos-core was complaining that padatious wasn't installed, I'll investigate how to install it.

I executed the install command for padatious:

pip3 install ovos-padatious

And found the swig 2.0 wasn't found. I needed to execute the install command for swig:

pip install swig

Then I ran the ovos-padatious install command again. I ran into another issue: fann2 was not installed.

I wanted to install fann, so I ran the following command:

pip install fann=1.0.7

But I ran into the same issues, of failing to compile necessary files.

The issue, apparently, is that the latest version of libfann-dev in Ubuntu is out of date. The solution is to then install the necessary files using the github repo:

git clone https://github.com/libfann/fann.git
cd ./fann
(optional: if cmake isn't installed) sudo apt install cmake
cmake .
sudo make install

I ran the padatious install again, and found another error:

error: invalid command "bdist_wheel"

So I had to install wheel:

pip install wheel

After installing wheel, I ran the padatious install command again, but this time, I entered an option:

pip3 install padatious --no-cache-dir

The option diable using the "cached" copy. The install succeeded in building padatious, but failed building fann2. This is ok, though, since I built fann2 from its github repo, and built it successfully (using cmake).
