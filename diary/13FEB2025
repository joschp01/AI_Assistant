After analyzing the message from running the command:
ovos-messagebus
ovos-core

I get pointed to ovos-padatious.

So far, here are some info that I found:
1. ovos-core
2. ovos-messagebus
3. padatious (ovos-padatious-pipeline-plugin)

I had read that there may be some skills that are already installed on ovos-core. To see the installed skills, it was suggested to use "mana."

To use mana, use the following steps:

# install the necessary package
pip install neon-mana-utils

# view the list of installed skills
mana get-skills-list

Note: to install skills, one can just use "pip."
Note: to find skills to install, look into PyPi or the OVOS GitHub Organization
