After analyzing the message from running the command:
ovos-messagebus
ovos-core

I get pointed to ovos-padatious.

So far, here are some info that I found:
1. ovos-core
2. ovos-messagebus
3. padatious (ovos-padatious-pipeline-plugin)

I had read that there may be some skills that are already installed on ovos-core. To see the installed skills, it was suggested to use "mana."

To use mana, use the following steps:

# install the necessary package
pip install neon-mana-utils

# view the list of installed skills
mana get-skills-list

Note: to install skills, one can just use "pip."
Note: to find skills to install, look into PyPi or the OVOS GitHub Organization

after running pip install neon-mana-utils, I got an error that states my ovos-workshop needs to be 3.3.4 <= x < 4.0.0. I need to update my ovos-workshop

pip install ovos-workshop==3.3.4

This ran successfully but I got the message:
ERROR: neon-utils 1.12.0 has requirement ovos-workshop>=0.0.15,~=0.0, but you'll have ovos-workshop 3.3.4 which is incompatible.

I don't know if neon-utils is important, but I can go back to this later to fix it.

I had continued, and found that ovos-core (with ovos-messagebus running) ran smoothly. I can continue with the dev and investigation.

apparently, mana is short for "Message Application for Neon AI," which is a "cutting-edge conversational artificial intelligence technology to empower users in the privacy of their own system, using open source software." So that's neat!
