To see if my version of ovos-core is installed correctly, I ran the command again:

pip install ovos-core

It ran successfully, and didn't give any errors.

I tried to run ovos-core, but the services didn't open correctly.

ovos-core

I deleted everything about ovos-core (deleted requirements.txt and venv associated with all installs of ovos-core).

I found ovos-installer, so I'll try that one.

To install ovos-installer, I used the following command (need sudo, curl, and git):

sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-installer/main/installer.sh)"

After running, the installer stated that the Python virtual environment was not created. The python version I have (3.8) is not compatible.

I installed Python3.9

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.9

# install venv for 3.9
sudo apt install python3.9-venv

After installing python3.9, I still ran into the same problem: ovos-installer is still not able to create the Python venv

I cloned the repo inside 1_wake_up/:
git clone https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-installer.git

I tried to install from within the repo, but it couldn't be installed using the following command:

pip install .

I will try using the automated installer found in the repo.
