Today, I found the Scenarios that can be found under the repo folder.

To launch the installer, I deepseek suggested to use the following command:

./ovos-installer -s <scenario.yaml>

where the scenario.yaml is the yaml file to be executed

~~~

none of that worked. I went back to ovos-core.

I did:

pip install ovos-core

I was prompted that my version of ovos-config has to be below 1.0.0, so I had to update:

pip install ovos-config==0.4.6

I ran the command again:

pip install ovos-core

and did not run into any issues.

Next time, I will try exploring the link:

https://openvoiceos.github.io/ovos-technical-manual/102-core/

Which is info for "ovos-core"
