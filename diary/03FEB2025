Downloaded Rhino from PicoVoice. The resource is not viable for this project, as it is not truly self contained. Rhino is "open-source," however, in order to use it, the user has to get an 'AccessKey,' which can only be obtained from PicoVoice.

A better option is Mycroft voice. However, Mycroft has ceased development. Luckily, a new group known as Open Voice OS (OVOS) has taken Mycroft's code, and continued developing it.
