Downloaded Rhino from PicoVoice. The resource is not viable for this project, as it is not truly self contained. Rhino is "open-source," however, in order to use it, the user has to get an 'AccessKey,' which can only be obtained from PicoVoice.

A better option is Mycroft voice. However, Mycroft has ceased development. Luckily, a new group known as Open Voice OS (OVOS) has taken Mycroft's code, and continued developing it.

You're correct! **Mycroft AI** (the original company) has indeed scaled back its development efforts, but the open-source community has stepped in to continue the project under the name **Open Voice OS (OVOS)**. OVOS is a community-driven fork of Mycroft that aims to keep the project alive, improve it, and expand its capabilities. Here's what you need to know about **OVOS**:

---

### **What is Open Voice OS (OVOS)?**
- **Community-Driven Fork**: OVOS is a continuation of the Mycroft AI project, maintained and developed by a passionate open-source community.
- **Mission**: To create a privacy-focused, open-source voice assistant platform that is modular, extensible, and accessible to everyone.
- **Core Philosophy**: OVOS emphasizes **user privacy**, **offline functionality**, and **customizability**.

---

### **Key Features of OVOS**
1. **Modular Architecture**:
   - OVOS retains Mycroft's modular design, allowing developers to plug in different components (e.g., STT, TTS, NLU) as needed.
   - You can replace or upgrade individual modules without affecting the entire system.

2. **Privacy-First**:
   - OVOS is designed to run entirely offline, ensuring that user data never leaves their device.
   - No reliance on cloud services unless explicitly configured by the user.

3. **Extensible Skills**:
   - Like Mycroft, OVOS supports custom skills (plugins) that can be written in Python.
   - The community is actively developing new skills and improving existing ones.

4. **Improved NLU**:
   - OVOS is working on enhancing natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities, making it easier to create complex voice interactions.

5. **Cross-Platform Support**:
   - OVOS can run on a variety of platforms, including Linux, Raspberry Pi, and other edge devices.

6. **Active Development**:
   - The OVOS community is actively developing and maintaining the codebase, with regular updates and improvements.

---

### **How OVOS Differs from Mycroft**
- **Community Ownership**: OVOS is not tied to a single company, making it more resilient to corporate decisions.
- **Focus on Offline Functionality**: OVOS places a stronger emphasis on offline capabilities and privacy.
- **Modernization**: The OVOS team is modernizing the codebase, improving performance, and adding new features.

1. **Installation**:
   - Visit the [OVOS GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS) for installation instructions.
   - OVOS can be installed on Linux-based systems, including Raspberry Pi.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Check out the [OVOS documentation](https://openvoiceos.github.io/) for guides on setting up, developing skills, and customizing your assistant.

3. **Community Support**:
   - Join the [OVOS community on Discord](https://discord.gg/mycroft) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#OpenVoiceOS:matrix.org) to ask questions, share ideas, and collaborate with other developers.

4. **Skills Development**:
   - Explore the [OVOS Skills Repository](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-skills) to find and contribute to existing skills.
   - Use the [Skill Development Guide](https://openvoiceos.github.io/developers/skills/) to create your own custom skills.

### **Example Use Cases for OVOS**
- **Smart Home Control**: Use OVOS to control IoT devices, lights, and appliances with voice commands.
- **Personal Assistant**: Create a custom assistant to manage your calendar, reminders, and tasks.
- **Education**: Build an interactive learning tool for students.
- **Enterprise Solutions**: Develop voice-enabled tools for businesses, such as inventory management or customer support.

---

### **Pros of Using OVOS**
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent and customizable.
- **Privacy-Focused**: No data leaves your device unless you configure it to.
- **Active Community**: Regular updates and a supportive community.
- **Modular and Extensible**: Easily add or replace components.

---

### **Cons to Consider**
- **Learning Curve**: Like Mycroft, OVOS requires some technical expertise to set up and customize.
- **Resource Requirements**: Running OVOS on low-power devices may require optimization.
- **Limited Pre-Built Skills**: While the community is growing, you may need to develop many skills yourself.

---

### **Conclusion**
If you're looking to build a **privacy-focused, open-source voice assistant**, **OVOS** is an excellent choice. It builds on the foundation of Mycroft while addressing some of its limitations and adding new features. With an active community and a commitment to offline functionality, OVOS is a promising platform for your voice AI assistant project. Check out their [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS) and [documentation](https://openvoiceos.github.io/) to get started!
