Downloaded Rhino from PicoVoice. The resource is not viable for this project, as it is not truly self contained. Rhino is "open-source," however, in order to use it, the user has to get an 'AccessKey,' which can only be obtained from PicoVoice.

A better option is Mycroft voice:

Yes, **Mycroft** is an excellent choice for building a **voice AI assistant** that can understand commands, gather and organize information, and respond with the results. Mycroft is designed specifically for creating customizable voice assistants, and its modular architecture allows you to extend its functionality to meet your needs. Here's how Mycroft can achieve what you're looking for:

---

### **1. Understanding Commands**
Mycroft uses **natural language understanding (NLU)** to interpret user commands. It comes with a built-in intent parser called **Adapt**, which allows you to define custom intents and entities. For example:
- You can define an intent like `"What's the weather in {location}?"` or `"Set a reminder for {time}."`
- Mycroft will extract the relevant information (e.g., `location` or `time`) and map it to the appropriate action.

If you need more advanced NLU capabilities, you can integrate Mycroft with **other NLU engines** like **Rasa** or **Dialogflow**.

---

### **2. Gathering Information**
Mycroft can gather information from various sources, depending on the skill (plugin) you create or use. For example:
- **Web APIs**: Mycroft can query external APIs to fetch data (e.g., weather, news, or stock prices).
- **Local Data**: It can access local files or databases to retrieve or store information.
- **Internet Search**: Mycroft can perform web searches to gather information dynamically.

You can write custom skills to interact with specific APIs or services. For example:
- A weather skill could fetch data from OpenWeatherMap.
- A calendar skill could integrate with Google Calendar.

---

### **3. Organizing Information**
Mycroft can process and organize information based on the command. For example:
- If you ask, *"What's on my calendar today?"*, Mycroft can fetch events, sort them by time, and prepare a response.
- If you ask, *"Find the top 3 news stories about AI,"* Mycroft can retrieve the news, filter for relevance, and organize the results.

You can implement this logic in your custom skills using Python. Mycroft's modular design makes it easy to add data processing and organization capabilities.

### **4. Talking Back with Results**
Mycroft uses **text-to-speech (TTS)** to respond to user commands. It supports multiple TTS engines, including:
- **Mimic 3** (Mycroft's open-source TTS engine).
- **Google TTS**.
- **Amazon Polly**.
- **eSpeak**.

You can customize the responses in your skills to ensure Mycroft speaks back with the results in a natural and user-friendly way. For example:
- If you ask for the weather, Mycroft can respond with, *"The weather in {location} is {temperature} degrees with {conditions}."*
- If you ask for a reminder, Mycroft can confirm, *"I've set a reminder for {time}."*

### **How to Get Started**
1. **Install Mycroft**:
   - Follow the official [Mycroft installation guide](https://mycroft.ai/get-started/).
   - You can install it on Linux, macOS, or Windows (using WSL).

2. **Explore Skills**:
   - Browse the [Mycroft Skills Repository](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-skills) for existing skills.
   - Install and test skills to understand how they work.

3. **Create Custom Skills**:
   - Use the [Mycroft Skill Development Guide](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/skills/) to create your own skills.
   - Define intents, gather data, process it, and generate responses.

4. **Test and Deploy**:
   - Test your assistant locally or on a device like the **Mark II** (Mycroft's smart speaker).
   - Deploy it to your desired platform (e.g., Raspberry Pi, desktop, or server).

### **Example Use Case**
Let’s say you want to create a voice assistant that can:
1. Understand commands like, *"What's the weather in New York?"*
2. Fetch weather data from an API.
3. Organize the data into a response.
4. Speak back: *"The weather in New York is 72 degrees with clear skies."*

Here’s how you’d do it:
1. Define an intent in Mycroft to recognize the command and extract the location.
2. Write a skill that queries a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) using the location.
3. Process the API response to extract temperature and conditions.
4. Use Mycroft’s TTS to speak the result.

---

### **Pros of Using Mycroft for Your Use Case**
- **Customizable**: You can tailor Mycroft to understand specific commands and perform unique tasks.
- **Open Source**: No vendor lock-in; you have full control over the code and data.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Runs offline, ensuring user data stays private.
- **Extensible**: You can add new skills and integrate with external services as needed.

---

### **Cons to Consider**
- **Setup Complexity**: Mycroft’s modular design can be overwhelming for beginners.
- **Resource Requirements**: Running Mycroft on low-power devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi) may require optimization.
- **Limited Pre-Built Skills**: While Mycroft has a growing library of skills, you may need to build many custom skills yourself.

---

### **Conclusion**
Mycroft is a powerful platform for building a **voice AI assistant** that can understand commands, gather and organize information, and respond with results. With its modular design and open-source nature, you can create a highly customized assistant tailored to your specific needs. If you’re willing to invest time in learning and development, Mycroft is an excellent choice for your project.
